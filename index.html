        <ul class="m-auto">
          <li>Born november 9, 1938 in Lewiston, Maine</li>
          <li>In 1947 family moves from Maine to Southern California</li>
          <li>As a member of the Southern California Falconry Club in 1953 he is itroduced to rapelling and climbing
          </li>
          <li>In 1957 Chouinard buys a used coal-fired forge and anvil, and teaches himself how to blacksmith in order
            to
            make his own pitons for climbing</li>
          <li>He sold pitons out of the trunk of his car for years while continuing to push climbing standards Yosemite,
            the Canadian Rockies and Patagonia</li>
          <li>In 1965 he started Chouinard Equipment, Ltd along with climbing partner Tom Frost</li>
          <li>In the late 1960's he and Frost began redesigning ice climbing tools to perform better on steeper ice,
            helping to start the modern sport of ice climbing</li>
          <li>In 1971 and 1972, Chouinard and Frost introduced new aluminum chockstones, called Hexentrics and Stoppers,
            ushering in &quot;clean climbing&quot;, and signaling the end of pitons.</li>
          <li>Brought back a rugby shirt from Scotland for use as a climbing shirt, and started selling them to people
            who
            wanted one. This led to the creation of his next company, Patagonia.</li>
          <li>Patagonia pledged in 1986 to donate 1% of sales or 10% of profits (whichever was greater) to environmental
            causes.</li>
          <li>In the same time they were providing employees healthy food at a company cafeteria and free child care
            long
            before this became the norm.</li>
          <li>Realizing that cotton production was one of biggest pollutants, the company began using only organic
            cotton
            for all its cotton clothing in 1996</li>
